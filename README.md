## **Adaptive Optimization, Fall 2021**
**1. Local Search Algorithms**

Based on the below well-known Rosenbrck function, try to apply several search algorithms and find the optimal solution using three local search algorithms. 

min⁡〖      〗 f(x,y)=(1-x)^2+〖100(y-x^2 )〗^2

	1. Gradient Ascent (Decent) Search
	2. Newton method
	3. Hill-Climbing

After apply three algorithms using Python, compare the performance among the algorithms.
